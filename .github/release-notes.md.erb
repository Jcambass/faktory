[Installation](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/wiki/Installation) | [Full docs](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/wiki/)

The Faktory Enterprise macOS packages are bare binaries which can replace the `faktory` binary installed by Homebrew. You are welcome to use either to trial the commercial functionality before purchase but they may not be used in a `production` environment without a license. Linux DEB packages and Docker images are available upon [purchase](https://contribsys.com/faktory).

Unpack them with `tar xvf faktory-ent-*.tbz; cp ./faktory /usr/local/bin`.

Note the `amd64` builds are for x86_64 processors (Intel, AMD). `arm64` builds are for ARM (Gravitron, Apple Silicon, etc) processors.
